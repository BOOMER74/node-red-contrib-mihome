### Using node template

To speed up integration of node for new device you can use [node template](nodes/template). It contains basic configuration and functions. Check [required devices](https://github.com/maxinminax/node-mihome/blob/master/DEVICES.md) in `node-mihome` package, which you can simply [initialize](https://github.com/maxinminax/node-mihome#create-device) and then call the device methods.
